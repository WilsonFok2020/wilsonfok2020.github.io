Prepare document Corpus The preprocessing step for the texts is largely the same as before. However, I have added more tokens in the dictionary by using unigram, bigram and trigram together. This combination is helpful for taking phrases such as “crystal structure” into account. data_raw = load_data() # raw data from Kaggle data_list = pickle.load( open( &quot;data_list.p&quot;, &quot;rb&quot; ) ) # with preprocessing done already # Build the bigram models bigram = gensim.models.phrases.Phrases(data_list[&#39;title&#39;], min_count=20, threshold=10) # Build the trigram models trigram = gensim.models.phrases.Phrases(bigram[data_list[&#39;title&#39;]], threshold=10) breakdown = trigram[data_list[&#39;title&#39;]] # Count n-gram frequencies frequency = defaultdict(int) for text in breakdown: for token in text: frequency[token] += 1 processed_corpus = [[token for token in text if frequency[token] &gt; 60] for text in data_list[&#39;abstract&#39;]] Some token examples: unigram_examples[0:10] Out[11]: [&#39;sequence&#39;, &#39;rna&#39;, &#39;transfer&#39;, &#39;synthesis&#39;, &#39;murine&#39;, &#39;coronavirus&#39;, &#39;receptor&#39;, &#39;family&#39;, &#39;novel&#39;, &#39;protein&#39;] bigram_examples[0:10] Out[12]: [&#39;crystal_structure&#39;, &#39;hepatitis_virus&#39;, &#39;rt_pcr&#39;, &#39;severe_acute&#39;, &#39;respiratory_syndrome&#39;, &#39;sars_cov&#39;, &#39;rna_synthesis&#39;, &#39;vaccinia_virus&#39;, &#39;sars_coronavirus&#39;, &#39;intensive_care&#39;] trigram_examples[0:10] Out[16]: [&#39;ucc_uuu_cgu&#39;, &#39;002_05_2015&#39;, &#39;x_xxy_yyz&#39;, &#39;x_xxz_zzn&#39;, &#39;run_tiled_primers&#39;, &#39;g_guu_uuu&#39;, &#39;dme1_chrx_2630566&#39;, &#39;ssc_circ_009380&#39;, &#39;vb_bbrs_phb09&#39;, &#39;vb_bbrm_phb04&#39;] Query I create a dictionary, convert the documents to a bag-of-word vectors, construct a term-frequency-inverse-document-frequency matrix, and calculate the similarity of the corpus based on cosine distance. ############ Gensim dictionary = corpora.Dictionary(processed_corpus) print(dictionary) bow_corpus = [dictionary.doc2bow(text) for text in processed_corpus] # train the model tfidf = models.TfidfModel(bow_corpus) corpus_tfidf = tfidf[bow_corpus] index = similarities.MatrixSimilarity(corpus_tfidf) Once I have the similarity matrix of the entire corpus, I can start to compare the query against each one of them. def parse(string, length=25): if isinstance(string, str): token, *vec = string.split(&#39; &#39;) vec = map(float, vec) return token, vec else: print (string) return None def flatten_list(x): return [ item for sublist in x for item in sublist] def preprocess_query(words, stopwords, wnl, dictionary): words = words.split(&#39; &#39;) words = [token.lower() for token in words] words = [token for token in words if token not in stopwords.words(&#39;english&#39;)] words = [wnl.lemmatize(token) for token in words] query_vec = dictionary.doc2bow(words) return query_vec def search(index, tfidf, word, stopwords, wnl, dictionary, data_raw, total_doc_samples): query_vec = preprocess_query(word, stopwords, wnl, dictionary) sims = index[tfidf[query_vec]] # keep track of how similar each document is to the query rank = {i:value for i, value in enumerate(sims)} sorted_rank = sorted(rank.items(), key=lambda x:x[1]) results = [] for i in range(1,total_doc_samples+1): string = data_raw[&#39;title&#39;][sorted_rank[-i][0]] results.append((sorted_rank[-i], string)) return results Search results I rank all the documents in the order of decreasing similarity and pick only the top 1000 most similar documents. from nltk.corpus import stopwords import nltk wnl = nltk.WordNetLemmatizer() words = &#39;Effectiveness of personal protective equipment and its usefulness to reduce risk of transmission in health care and community settings&#39; total_doc_samples = 1000 results = search(index, tfidf, words, stopwords, wnl, dictionary, data_raw, total_doc_samples) x = np.zeros((len(results), len(dictionary)), dtype=np.float16) sim_x = np.zeros((len(results),), dtype=np.float16) sim_doc_titles = [] for i, result in enumerate(results): index = result[0][0] doc = corpus_tfidf[index] col = [item[0] for item in doc] v = [item[1] for item in doc] x[i, col] = v sim_x[i] = result[0][1] sim_doc_titles.append(result[1]) Since a dry list of documents may be boring to look at, I cluster the search results and put them in a tree. Sklearn provides a very handy script which I adopt for this subtask. from sklearn.cluster import AgglomerativeClustering model = AgglomerativeClustering(affinity=&#39;cosine&#39;, distance_threshold=0, n_clusters=None, linkage=&#39;complete&#39;) model = model.fit(x) from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import dendrogram def plot_dendrogram(model, **kwargs): # Create linkage matrix and then plot the dendrogram # create the counts of samples under each node counts = np.zeros(model.children_.shape[0]) n_samples = len(model.labels_) for i, merge in enumerate(model.children_): current_count = 0 for child_idx in merge: if child_idx &lt; n_samples: current_count += 1 # leaf node else: current_count += counts[child_idx - n_samples] counts[i] = current_count linkage_matrix = np.column_stack([model.children_, model.distances_, counts]).astype(float) # Plot the corresponding dendrogram dendrogram(linkage_matrix, **kwargs) plt.title(&#39;Hierarchical Clustering Dendrogram&#39;) # plot the top three levels of the dendrogram plot_dendrogram(model, truncate_mode=&#39;level&#39;, p=4) plt.xlabel(&quot;Number of points in node (or index of point if no parenthesis).&quot;) plt.ylabel(&quot;distances&quot;) plt.savefig(os.path.join(output_dir, &#39;dendrogram_similar_docs.png&#39;), transparent=True , dpi=400, bbox_inches=&#39;tight&#39;) plt.show() The similarity of documents decays gradually and there aren’t that many semantically similar documents to the query have been found. I group highly similar documents in red, moderately similar documents in blue, and not-quite similar documents in green. I personally would say only those in red are relatively relevant and are therefore worth reading the full content of the articles. Here are the list of some of the titles in each color group.
